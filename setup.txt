Basic setup guide.

requirements:

Time.
Coffee.

MYR Wallet(s) and P2Pool instances


Rough instructions:

1. Create database on mariaDB
2. Import sql/myriad.sql into database
3. create user who has rights to database
4. change config.inc.php in both /cron and /web/include to include database connection details
5. put in MYR RPC details into /crom/config.inc.php
6. edit tblnodes with information for each node you are pulling information for
7. define nodes for global stats in /cron/p2pinfo.php lines 191 & 204
8. edit cron/runjobs.sh to have correct path to runjobs.php and php executable
9. create a cron job to run /cron/runjobs.sh every minute
10. publish /web to root of your new website
11. you'll need a pile of apache rewrite rules to make the nice paths work.
12. configure apache to only allow access to /web/vcp to authorised users - it's the admin bit
13. edit tblmergedcoins for merged coin wallets
14. read lots of code
